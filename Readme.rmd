# **Simulation Craft Files**

This will be my main repository for uploading all files relating to the Simc threads I create for the Altered-Time website. 

## **Contents**

- Folders will be and will contain the following:
    * Specs
    * Type of sim (e.g. Legendary Combos Single Target, Talent Combos Multi Target etc.)
    * This will also include any .bat files I use to automate the process.

## **Projects Progress:**

- 7.3.5: As soon as 7.3.5 is released, sims will start to generate.
